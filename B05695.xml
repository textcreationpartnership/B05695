         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Foraſmuch as, by the third Act of the fourth Seſſion of Our current Parliament, We with Advice and Conſent of the Eſtates of Parliament, <hi>did Impoſe and Ordain</hi> an Additional Exciſe of Three pennies upon the Pint of Ale and Beer browen, and to be vended and ſold within this Kingdom, and Two ſhilling upon the Pint of Aquavite and Strong-waters made of Malt, or otherways as in the ſaid Act, and did ſet down and appoint certain Methods and Rules for Levying, Raiſing and Uplifting the ſame, in manner mentioned in the ſaid Act; And with Advice and Conſent foreſaid did Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize and impower the Lords of Our privy Council, to preſcribe ſuch other Methods and Orders as they ſhould judge neceſſar, for making the ſaid Act effectual, and We conſidering the great hinderance the Tackſmen of Our ſaid Additional Exciſe meet with in the ſeveral Shires, for uplifting the ſaid Three pennies, and two ſhilling of Exciſe impoſed in manner foreſaid, by the not meeting of the Commiſſioners of Supply, duely and frequently, to determine all differences between the Brewers and Tackſmen, their Sub-trackſmen &amp; Collectors, and for want of orderly &amp; rimous Entries by the Brewers, of all Liquors browen by them lyable to the ſaid Exciſe, wherethrow great Loſs and Prejudice doth ariſe to that Branch of the Supply granted to Us thereby: For Remeed whereof, We with Advice of the Lords of Our Privy Council, strictly Require and Command, the whole Commiſſioners of Supply in all the Shires within this Kingdom, <hi>qualified according to Law,</hi> and who by the ſaid Act of Parliament, are appointed Commiſſioners of the ſaid Additional Exciſe, to meet at the Head burghs of their reſpective Shires, at the days reſpective following, <hi>viz</hi>: Theſe on this ſide of the River of <hi>Tay,</hi> upon the ſecond <hi>Tueſday</hi> of <hi>January</hi> next, and theſe on the other ſide of the ſaid River of <hi>Tay,</hi> upon the Third <hi>Tueſday</hi> of the ſaid Moneth, and at their Meetings to ſettle and appoint places, ſuch as they ſhall find moſt convenient, where publick Exciſe-offices ſhall be keeped, for the Brewers to enter and give up the quantities of the Liquors browen by them, lyable in payment of the ſaid Exciſe; And appoints the ſaids Commiſſioners Immediatly after deſigning the places for the ſaids Offices, to cauſe make publick Intimation at all the Church-doors within the ſaids reſpective Shires, of the particular Places deſigned by them for the ſeveral Exciſe-offices, with Certification to the ſaids Ccmmiſſioners, or any of them reſiding within the ſaids reſpective Shires, who ſhall failȝie to meet at the ſaid, days reſpective above ſet down, and to appoint and deſign the particular Places for, Exciſe-offices in manner above expreſt, they ſhall be, and are hereby Fined, each of them, in the Sum of One hundred pounds <hi>Scots</hi> for the ſaid abſence, to be charged for, upon a ſimple Charge of ſix days, and uplifted by the Collectors of Supply of the reſpective Shires, for which effect, Letters are hereby Authorized to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected at the inſtance;
